ROOMS WITHOUT KEYWORDS
======================

The following JSON files in public/data/ do NOT have any keyword definitions:

1. Meaning_Of_Life_vip1.json
2. Meaning_Of_Life_vip2.json  
3. Meaning_Of_Life_vip3.json
4. Philosophy_Of_Everyday_vip1.json

ANALYSIS:
---------
These 4 files lack keyword structures entirely, meaning the keyword responder system cannot match user queries to these rooms. The files only contain tier, title, and content fields.

NOTE: Other rooms use various keyword formats:
- keywords_en/keywords_vi (in entries or root)
- keywords object with en/vi sub-objects
- keywords_dict with entry mappings
- keyword_menu arrays

RECOMMENDATION:
---------------
Add keyword structures to these 4 files to enable proper room routing and search functionality.
