Grand Plan for VIP3 Room: Calm Money, Clear Future – A Human, Shame-Aware Journey to Financial PeaceNo hype. No guarantees. Just clarity, calm, and a practical path forward — built for MercyB’s tone and your users’ real lives.App-Wide Disclaimer (One-Time, First Screen Only)This app shares education and ideas to help you think about money. It is not personalized financial, tax, or legal advice. Always speak with a licensed professional for your unique situation. If you’re in crisis (debt collectors, eviction, etc.), reach out to local support services first.
Core Philosophy (Internal Only)“Money doesn’t have to hurt. You’re allowed to start exactly where you are — even if that’s $0, debt, or fear.”
We guide, we don’t promise. We reduce shame, not add pressure.
We use CFA/CFP rigor under the hood — users just feel supported.Room Overview (User-Facing)Room Name
