=== BUILD DIAGNOSIS LOG ===
Date: 2025-12-03

=== ISSUES IDENTIFIED ===

1. CRITICAL: netlify.toml Misconfiguration
   - File: netlify.toml
   - Problem: Configured for Next.js (.next directory, @netlify/plugin-nextjs)
   - This is a Vite/React project that outputs to dist/
   - Status: FIXED

2. DATA: Missing voiceQuiet key in EN companion JSON
   - File: public/data/companion_lines_friend_en.json
   - Problem: VI file had voiceQuiet, EN file did not
   - getRandomCompanionLine('voiceQuiet') would fail for EN users
   - Status: FIXED

=== FILES MODIFIED ===

1. netlify.toml
   - Changed: publish = ".next" → publish = "dist"
   - Removed: [[plugins]] package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"
   - Fixed: redirect paths /public/data/* → /data/*

2. public/data/companion_lines_friend_en.json
   - Added: "voiceQuiet" array with 2 fallback messages

=== VERIFICATION CHECKLIST ===
[x] netlify.toml uses correct Vite config
[x] Both companion JSON files have all required keys
[x] No process.env references in client code
[x] No NEXT_PUBLIC_ references (not needed for Vite)
[x] Companion imports use fetch, not static imports

=== PUBLISH SHOULD NOW SUCCEED ===
